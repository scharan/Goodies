# Script to 'restore' ssh agent across screen/tmux sessions.
# `ls ...` finds the most recent (current) agent.pid file. But it does not 
# return the full path of that file. The find part of the command returns the
# full path of the file that is then exported in the appropriate variable.
#
# Inspired from: http://www.tolaris.com/2011/07/12/reconnecting-your-ssh-agent-to-a-detached-gnu-screen-session/
# Modified to find the 'current' agent.pid file. The above does not always 
# return the current agent.pid file.
#
# To run, you MUST invoke it as:
# $ . /path/to/this/script OR
# $ source /path/to/this/script
#
# Invoking it as /path/to/this/script will not work since that will be run in a 
# newly forked shell that dies on script exit and will not export the variable 
# in the current shell.

export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=$(find /tmp/ssh-* -name `ls -alth /tmp/ssh-* | grep \`whoami\` | grep agent | head -n 1 | awk '{print $8}'`)
